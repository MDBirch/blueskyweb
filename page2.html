        <h1>The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>(1.1)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>IT is essential for modern business. The correct IT systems and software may make the difference between an efficient, well planned operation, compared to a poorly run, ineffective and unefficient business.<br>Long gone are the days when an organisation can exist without internet presence. In terms of retail industries, consumers trends and attitudes have been continually evolving, and now internet purchases are the norm. In 2019, as high as 82% of UK households made online purchases within the preceding 12 months, and all e-commerce sales in 2018 totalled 688.4bn GBP, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2333/e-commerce-in-the-united-kingdom/">(reference)</a> and this is reflected in the year on year decline of high street stores.<br>In terms of service industries, a recent trend of ordering food online, instead of going to the shop to eat or collect it, has been boosted by companies such as ubereats, deliveroo, just-eat and foodhub, just to name a few. So, if you're a food retailer and you have no presence on these websites, it puts you at a big disadvantage compared to your competitors.<br>The convenience of online ordering is appealing to the consumer as it saves time and often money, compared to travelling to the shop. Also the overheads of high street stores compared to the economies of scale of Amazon, for example, means that products can be sold cheaper online. Consumers online, also have the added benefit of being able to compare similar items at the click of a button, and read customer satisfaction reviews from users of that product or service.<br>The power of the retailer can also be boosted by IT. The collection of consumer data, means advertising can be directed to the people most likely to be interested in that product or service. See <a href="page8.html">Unit 1.7</a> for more information on the laws governing this data collection.<br>This fast paced, ever changing landscape makes it important for businesses to have up to date hardware systems, and keep up to date with new software and technologies that will become the essential tools for tomorrow</p>
