        <h1>Risks That Impact Digital Projects</h1>
        <p>According to a 2017 report from the <abbr title="Project Management Institute">PMI</abbr> 14% of IT projects fail. However, that number only represents the total failures. Of the projects that didn't fail outright, 31% didn't meet their goals, 43% exceeded their initial budgets and 49% were late.<br>Poor project management can be cause of failure. For example, The Shared Services Transformation Programme was an IT project designed for use by the Department of Transport in the UK. The estimated cost for the project was £55.4 million, but would save the department £112.4 million over ten years. Multiple changes and unexpected complexities arose, and by the time the problems had been identified the cost of the project had risen to £121.2 million, while the anticipated savings had decreased to £40.1 million. So instead of saving money, it actually cost them £80 million.(ref pdf)<br> Cybersecurity is very important to implement for most businesses and projects. Cyber attacks have become more prevalent in recent times. In May 2017, the 'Wannacry' ransomware attack infected an estimated 230,000 computers in 150 countries within 24 hours. In the UK, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> was heavily affected by this cyber attack. Computers running on outdated operating systems, which were unpatched, meant they were completely unprepared against such threats.(ref pdf) Now that people's personal details are increasingly stored online by many types of organisations, a successful cyber attack on IT systems that steal this data can seriously affect a business in terms of consumer loyalty and trust.<br> Digital Projects are reliant on connectivity. Server capacity and reliability are also to be considered in terms of risks. If a server goes down, projects and businesses can be left incapacitated.
