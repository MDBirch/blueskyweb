        <h2 class="center">My Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Mark Birch.<br>I am a business management graduate (BA honours).<br>I have worked as a laboratory technician, testing plastic pipelines for use in the water industry, and more recently i have been a full time professional poker player from 2008 - 2019. Some of my fields of interests include science, history, nature, psychology and technology. I have played Chess regularly, since a junior, to a high level for club and county. I have also enjoyed designing and writing computer and board games for many years. Currently my focus is on website development and coding.

        <h2 class="center">Technology Experience</h2>
        <p>I have always been interested in computers throughout my life, since my first experiences with them in the 1980's.<br> I had access to the early forms of personal computers like the IBM, 386, 486 and Apple macintosh, and learnt a lot about what they can do and how they work, mainly through self teaching.<br> Later on as i gained more experience in software and hardware, i learnt how to build personal computers from components, install operating systems and and also network multiple computers.<br> I also was part of the generation that were the first to experience the internet 'boom' of the 1990's. Spending a lot of time on the internet, exploring all the things it can be used for and creating basic forms of my own website, opened my eyes to the future potential this new technology held.

        <h2 class="center">Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>After some time out focusing on higher education, careers and projects, i decided to go back and focus on current technology, new advances on the internet and learn programming.<br> Taking up a course through <a href="https//wearecodenation.com">Code Nation</a> i have learnt to use the programming language python, make a text based computer game and create websites using HTML and CSS. Like this one you're viewing right now.
